## Versioning Scheme

We follow Semantic Versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update this CHANGELOG
3. Create git tag: `git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v2.0.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create release

## Migration Guides

### From 1.0 to 2.0

#### Using the Library

**Before (v1.0):**
```rust
mod models;
use models::*;
```

**After (v2.0):**
```rust
use rust_ml::*;
use rust_ml::models::*;
```

#### Error Handling

**Before (v1.0):**
```rust
fn train() -> tch::Result<()> {
    // ...
}
```

**After (v2.0):**
```rust
fn train() -> MLResult<()> {
    // ...
}
```

#### Configuration

**Before (v1.0):**
Hard-coded hyperparameters in code

**After (v2.0):**
```rust
let config = Config::from_file("config.toml")?;
```
